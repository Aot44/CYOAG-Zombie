# CYOAG-Zombie
Choose Your Own Adventure Zombie Game

The HTML games included are intended to be played using Fabularium on a mobile device. If you play this on any other system you may see that the items shift on screen due to my poor coding skills. These games were created using Twine (Story Format: Harlowe 3.2.3) twinery.org and can be edited if needed. This was originally a collage project that was converted to work with Fabularium.

Install Fabularium on you mobile device and launch it.
Download and then place the Test folder, Zombie1.html and Zombie2.html files in the path "Internal Storage>Fabularium>Games".
Once the files and folder are placed in the folder go into the Fabularium app on the Play tab press the refresh button.
